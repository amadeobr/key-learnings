I was surprised by the concept that the average useful life of code is around 18 months. I had the idea that developing software
was more akin to an investment - you spend a lot of money once, but it produces results for a long time. I now understand that
it is really an expense that you have to incur recurrently. This is an important element to consider - many tech startup pitches
fail to adequately reflect this fact.
