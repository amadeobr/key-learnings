developing code is a constant struggle between perfection and budget (monetary and time)
the architectural structuring of code should be a fluid process which runs parallel to coding rather than front loaded by the business people and then waiting for a finished product
github is a very elaborate repository system which is effective in large teams.
talented coders dont like working in large organizations
