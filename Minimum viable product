I learned that it's best to launch a minimum viable product and not wait and spend the money to get a perfect product.
You will likely fail often and have to pivot from the original idea, so it's better to start learning quickly and cheaply.
This is why it makes more sense to test an idea with a website before launching an app in most cases, because it is quicker
and easier to make changes, and failure will be less costly.  This was the most important take away in my opinion.
this is great
