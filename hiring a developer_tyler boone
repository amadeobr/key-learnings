1)  When hiring a developer, it is important that:
- look for ones that utilize ruby on rails and Python
- also, you should ask if they have a github profile. not having one is a bad sign
- ensure there is frequent discussions to make sure the dev team is not going in the wrong direction
- it's easier to attract talent by offering cash - developers typically view the equity as worthless
