I've learned that pragmatism is essential to programming effectively and efficiently. A few of my most valuable learnings:
- Use an existing framework or software package where possible (e.g. Ruby on Rails, Shopify, PhoneGap)
- Use an overly simple setup to test your product, and then expand. Start with an MVP and build from there
- Focus on a few key 'must-have' features, and test them rigorously. Only expand functionality later.
- Sketch out a model of the product before you start coding
- Your estimates / planning doesn't have to be 100% accurate, they have to be accurate enough. Similarly, your initial product doesn't have to be perfect, it has to be good enough.
