I was surprised to learn that usually the best advice you can get when you plan to specify your own software is "Don't".
It's easy to focus on the intelectually stimulating technical issues of designing the ideal software and forget to test your premise that consumers actually want what you intend to sell in the first place. Your scarce time and resources are usually better spent in testing the concept behind your product than in fully fleshing out the software beforehand.
