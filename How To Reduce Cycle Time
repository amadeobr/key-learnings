Key lever to pull to reduce development cost: minimize cycle time
One can do this by using:
> frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails)
> SCRUM methodology (e.g., product owner, dev team, scrum master and prioritization using real estimates, planning poker, t-shirt sizes, story count)
> a solution such as Shopify when building a webshop
> reduce waste and save time by testing early (e.g., use Minimum Viable Product and test early)
